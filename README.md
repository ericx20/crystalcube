## CFOP Cross & ZZ EO Trainers

Improves your first step efficiency: lets you learn from computer-optimal solutions with visualization

- Novel 3D cube visualizer highlights bad edges for EO and how they get eliminated
- Scrambles are random-state or can be set to a specific level
- Fast solver that generates optimal solutions for cross, EO, EOLine, EOCross
- Inspired by [Onionhoney's Roux Trainers](https://onionhoney.github.io/roux-trainers/)

## OH Scrambler

Generates fair scrambles that are easy to do one-handed

- `<R, U, F, L, D, B>` moves are translated to `<R, U, F, r, u f>`
- Supports both conventions for wide moves (Rw, r)
- Modes for left or right hand

## Cube solver library

The trainer is powered by `crystalcube`'s own cube library with some functionality from [`cubing.js`](https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js). It's focused on generating solutions for the first step of ZZ and CFOP, and can also solve first steps of any method you define!

- This library is still being developed and doesn't have documentation yet, and it could be replaced by cubing.js in the future

## Development

Make sure you have Node.js 19 or later installed!
